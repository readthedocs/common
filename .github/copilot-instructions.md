# Copilot Instructions for Read the Docs

## Commits

* Use short descriptive commit messages
* Only provide simple context, and don't be overly verbose

## Pull Requests

* Put a footer note that this was generated by Copilot
* Use feature branches for all changes
* Don't include a "Changes" section, since the PR content is self-explanatory
* Link related issues in the PR description, if there are any in the chat context
* Use the `pr` tool with a text file for the description


## Package Management
- Always use `uv` for Python package management and virtual environment operations
- Use `uv pip install` instead of `pip install`
- Use `uv run` to execute Python scripts in the virtual environment

## Docs

* Use the style guide at ``docs/dev/style-guide.rst``.
* Always use the marketing name used in the public-facing docs, and not the internal code names referenced in code.
* The ``user`` directory is public docs, and ``dev`` is dev-focused. Most of what we do is focus on the user-facing docs. 

## Testing
- Use `pytest` as the testing framework
- Write succinct, focused tests that test one thing at a time
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Place tests in appropriate test files following the project structure
- Always keep the test db with ``pytest --reuse-db`` to speed up test runs

## Code Quality
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints for function signatures
- Write clear, concise docstrings for public functions and classes
- Format all Python code with ruff before committing
- Run linting checks on all code changes before submitting
